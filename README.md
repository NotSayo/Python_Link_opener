# A simple link opener done in python

 Just import all the links into the 'links.txt' file in the format '1 link per line' and run the script 
 On the first launch you will be asked to input your preferred browser, which will be saved for later uses.
 In case you want to change it go to 'Browser.json and open it using a tool like VS Code, then delete the part that says the browser you have chosen and only that.

 If you encounter any problems be sure to let me know
 That's all from me :)
